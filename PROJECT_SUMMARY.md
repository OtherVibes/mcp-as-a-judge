# MCP as a Judge - Project Summary

## ✅ Project Completed Successfully

I have successfully created the "MCP as a Judge" project as requested. Here's what was built:

## 🎯 Project Overview

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a software engineering judge to validate coding plans and code changes against best practices.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **MCP Server** (`src/mcp_as_a_judge/__init__.py`)
   - Built using FastMCP from the official MCP Python SDK
   - Uses Python 3.12 with uv for dependency management
   - Implements MCP sampling to query the client LLM for judgments

2. **Two Mandatory Judge Tools**:

   **`judge_coding_plan`**
   - Description: "You MUST call this tool prior making any code change to validate your coding plan follows SWE best practices."
   - **Requires**: plan, design, research (all mandatory parameters)
   - Forces agents to provide comprehensive system design and thorough research
   - Validates against design quality, research thoroughness, architecture, security, testing, and maintainability
   - Uses LLM sampling for intelligent analysis

   **`judge_code_change`**
   - Description: "You MUST call this tool prior making any code change to validate the implementation follows SWE best practices."
   - Reviews actual code changes for quality, security, performance, error handling, and maintainability
   - Provides structured feedback with approval/revision status

### Key Features Implemented

✅ **Mandatory Usage Enforcement**: Both tools have descriptions that force the host to use them
✅ **LLM Sampling**: Uses MCP sampling to leverage the client LLM for expert-level analysis
✅ **Comprehensive Review Criteria**: Covers all major SWE best practices
✅ **Structured Output**: Returns formatted responses with status and recommendations
✅ **Latest MCP SDK**: Uses mcp[cli] latest version as requested
✅ **Python 3.12 + uv**: Modern Python setup with uv package management

## 🚀 Usage

### Installation
```bash
cd mcp-as-a-judge
uv sync
```

### Running
The server is designed to be used via MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cline, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-as-a-judge": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp-as-a-judge"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-as-a-judge"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Review Criteria

### For Coding Plans:
- Architecture & Design (SOLID principles, modularity)
- Security (vulnerabilities, best practices)
- Code Reuse & Dependencies (library usage, avoiding reinvention)
- Testing Strategy (approach, edge cases)
- Performance & Scalability
- Maintainability (structure, documentation)

### For Code Changes:
- Code Quality (cleanliness, conventions)
- Security (vulnerabilities, input validation)
- Performance (algorithm choice, efficiency)
- Error Handling (comprehensive coverage)
- Testing (testability, coverage)
- Dependencies & Reuse
- Maintainability (patterns, documentation)

## ✅ Testing

All tests pass:
- Server initialization ✓
- Tool registration ✓
- Import functionality ✓
- Package entry point ✓

## 🎉 Mission Accomplished

The project fully meets all requirements:
- ✅ Python with uv
- ✅ MCP[cli] latest version
- ✅ FastMCP server implementation
- ✅ Two judge tools with mandatory descriptions
- ✅ LLM sampling for intelligent analysis
- ✅ SWE best practices validation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Working test suite

The server is ready to be integrated with MCP clients and will enforce software engineering best practices by requiring validation before any code changes!
